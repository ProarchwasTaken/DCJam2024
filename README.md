# Introduction
Hello everyone, this is Tyler. This game was made for Dungeon Crawler Jam
2024. Where you would have to make a dungeon crawler in under about 9 
days. This is the second game jam I ever participated in. Not only that,
this is also the first project where I'm working with someone else, so
this is a momumental occasion that I would like to be remembered.

The game would be writen in C++ using the Raylib framework. My role in the
the project would be to program the game itself, and create the sound
effects and music. My teammate, which I will be refering to by her
username which is: the_saver1, would be responsible for the game's art.

The 4 themes for the gamejam are: Infinity/The Endless, Ancient Ruins, 
Solitude, and Cosmic Horror. The game has to incorporate at least one of
these themes. The ones we agreed to go with for now are: Ancient Ruins,
and Solitude.

9 days to create a dungeon crawler, we really gonna have to lock in for
this one. At least it would be a good learning experience as I never
worked with other people on a game before.
